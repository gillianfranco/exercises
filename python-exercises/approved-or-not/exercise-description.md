# Exercise - Approved or not

Develop a program that asks the user for three grades obtained in an exam. The program should calculate the average of these grades and, based on the result, check if the student passed. For approval, all grades must be equal or higher than 7. In the end, the program should display the average of the grades and inform whether the student is approved or not.
