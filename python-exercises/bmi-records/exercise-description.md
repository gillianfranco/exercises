# Exercise - BMI records

Write an algorithm that reads the name, height, and weight of people, and stores the information in a list. The program should register an indefinite number of entries and also store each person's BMI in the list. At the end of the program, print the complete list and also:

• the total number of registrations; 
• the person with the highest BMI; 
• the person with the lowest BMI.

The BMI calculation must be performed using a lambda function and is given by: BMI = weight / (height²).
