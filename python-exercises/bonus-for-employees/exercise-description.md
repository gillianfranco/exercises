# Exercise - Bonus for employees

A company granted a 30% bonus to all employees with more than 10 years at the company and a 20% bonus to all employees with more than five years at the company. All others who do not fall into these categories received a 10% bonus only. Write an algorithm that reads the employee's salary and their time at the company, and displays each employee's bonus on the screen.
