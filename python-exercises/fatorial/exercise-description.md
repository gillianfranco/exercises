# Exercise - Fatorial

Factorial is a positive integer, represented by n! We calculate the factorial by multiplying this number n by all its predecessors down to 1. Also, the factorial of 0! will always be 1. Considering this brief explanation about factorials, write a function that calculates the factorial of a number received as a parameter and returns its result. Validate the data through another function, allowing only positive values to be accepted.
