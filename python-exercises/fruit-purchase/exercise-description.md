# Exercise - Fruit Purchase

Write a Python algorithm where the user chooses if they want to buy apples, oranges, or bananas. A menu should be displayed on the screen with option 1 for apple, 2 for orange, and 3 for banana.

After the fruit is chosen, the user must input how many units they want to buy. The algorithm should calculate the total price to pay for the selected product and display it on the screen.

Consider that an apple costs R$ 2.30, an orange R$ 3.60, and a banana R$ 1.85.
