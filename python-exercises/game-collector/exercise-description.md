# Exercise - Game collector

Suppose you are a video game collector. Write an algorithm that allows you to register these games by providing the name and which video game it belongs to. To do this, create a menu of options containing: register new item, list everything that has been registered, and exit. To solve this exercise, create at least one function for each option in the menu. Additionally, store all the data in a text file that should be saved on disk and keep the registered data.
