Create a rock-paper-scissors game. You will play against the computer. You must always choose one of the following options:
1 - Rock
2 - Paper
3 - Scissors

The computer will randomly select a number from 1 to 3 to play. Store all the results in a list, and at the end, display the winner. End the program by entering zero.
