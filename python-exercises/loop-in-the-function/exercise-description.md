# Exercise - Loop in the function

Write a routine that creates a loop that performs a count and prints this count on the screen in a single line. However, as a parameter, the function should receive the initial value of the count, the final value, and the step of the iteration. Leave the initial and step parameters as optional. You can use either a 'for' or 'while' loop.
