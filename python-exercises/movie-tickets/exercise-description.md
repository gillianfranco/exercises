# Exercise - Movie tickets

Write a loop in which you ask users for their age and then inform them of the movie ticket price. End the loop using 'break' when the user enters zero. After ending the loop, display the total number of people who bought tickets, the total amount of money collected, and the average age of the people. 

A cinema charges different prices for tickets according to the person's age. If the person is under 3 years old, the ticket will be free; if they are between 3 and 12 years old, the ticket will cost R$15; if they are over 12 years old, the ticket will cost R$30.
