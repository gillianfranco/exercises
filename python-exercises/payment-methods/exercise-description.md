# Exercise - Payment Methods

A department store is offering different payment options, as listed below. Write an algorithm that reads the total value of a purchase and calculates the final payment amount according to the chosen option.

If the choice is for installment payments, also calculate the value of each installment. In the end, display the total purchase amount and the value of the installments:
• Cash payment – grant a 5% discount;
• Payment in 3 installments – no changes to the amount;
• Payment in 5 installments – an additional 2%;
• Payment in 10 installments – an additional 8%.
