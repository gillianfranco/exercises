# Exercise - Print the hours

Write an algorithm that prints the time in the format H:M
within a range defined by the user. The user should specify the hour range they want to print (for example, from 7h to 14h). Validate the input data so that your program only accepts valid hour values (from 0 to 23h) and that the initial hour entered is not greater than the final hour. If this happens, the user should enter the range again.
