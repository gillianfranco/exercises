# Exercise - Sequential search

The simplest algorithm to search for data in a data structure is called a sequential search. A sequential search is a simple scan from the first to the last element of the structure, checking if the desired data is present.

Write a function in Python that takes a list and a data item as parameters. Check if the data is present in the list and return its index from the function if it is present. Otherwise, return -1.
