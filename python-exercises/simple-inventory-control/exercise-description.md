# Exercise - Simple inventory control

Create a Python program for inventory control of a store that sells fruits and vegetables. For the inventory, store everything in a dictionary containing lists. The key should be the name of each product, and within each list, we will have the price and the available quantity in stock. The inventory can be pre-registered in the system with as many items as desired.

Simulate a purchase. Ask the user to enter the product name and the desired quantity until they decide to finish the purchase. At the end, display everything on the screen in an organized format, showing the total amount to be paid for each product and the final total of the order.

Additionally, update the system by deducting what was purchased from the total in stock. Display the remaining stock on the screen.
