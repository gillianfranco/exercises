# Exercise - Student grades

Write a Python program that reads a student's name and three grades. Store the name and the arithmetic average of the grades in a dictionary. 

Additionally, store the student's situation in the dictionary: 
• Average >= 7, approved; 
• Average < 7 and >= 5, in exam; 
• Average < 5, failed. 

Display everything on the screen at the end of the program in an organized format.
