# Exercise - Triangle Classification

Create an algorithm that receives three values, representing the sides of a triangle provided by the user. Verify if the values form a triangle and classify it as:

a) Equilateral (three equal sides);
b) Isosceles (two equal sides);
c) Scalene (three different sides).

Remember that to form a triangle, none of the sides can be zero, and no side can be greater than the sum of the other two.
